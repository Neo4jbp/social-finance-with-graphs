#Building a graph database application
##Develop our graph model in a test-driven fashion

#Story time
I left my wallet in the office and we are heading to the restaurant...
---
#Story time
...I need money,<br>or I starve to death ðŸ˜±...
---
#Story time
...but nobody will borrow me money, if they don't trust me.


---
#Solution
Track the $$<br>
in a transparent way.


---
#The .green[*questions*] drive the modeling process


---
.green[AS A] person who happily give money to my teammates,
.green[I WANT] to know, who can I trust with borrowing money,
.green[SO THAT] I get my money back.

Nodes for Things, Relationships for Structure

- Nodes
- Relationships
- Relationship direction
- Node properties
- Relationship properties
???
- Nodes: the things in our domain that are of .green[interest to us], and which .green[can be labeled and grouped].

- Relationships: both to express the connections between entities and to establish semantic context for each entity, thereby .green[structuring the domain].

- Relationship direction: to .green[further clarify] relationship semantics. Many relationships are asymmetrical, which is why relationships in a property graph are always directed. .green[For bidirectional relationships], we should make our queries .green[ignore direction], rather than using two relationships.

- Node properties: to represent entity .green[attributes], plus any necessary entity .green[metadata], such as timestamps, version numbers, etc.

- Relationship properties: to express the .green[strength, weight, or quality] of a relationship, plus any necessary relationship .green[metadata], such as timestamps, version numbers, etc

Fine-Grained versus Generic Relationships

Use well named relationship types to avoid some use of labels
